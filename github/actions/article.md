## What is GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is a **CI/CD platform built directly into GitHub** that automates your software workflows. Think of it as your personal DevOps assistant that:

- ‚úÖ Runs tests automatically on every pull request
- üèóÔ∏è Builds your applications when you push code
- üöÄ Deploys to production when you create a release
- üì¶ Publishes packages to registries
- ‚è∞ Runs scheduled maintenance tasks

**Why GitHub Actions?**
- **Native Integration**: Already built into GitHub
- **Free Tier**: 2,000 minutes/month for public repos
- **Rich Ecosystem**: Thousands of pre-built actions
- **Flexible**: Supports any language and deployment target

---

## Core Concepts You Must Know

Understanding these five concepts will make everything else click:

### 1. **Workflow**
A complete automation process defined in a YAML file stored in `.github/workflows/`

### 2. **Event (Trigger)**
What starts your workflow:
```yaml
on:
  push:              # On every push
  pull_request:      # On every PR
  schedule:          # Cron-based scheduling
  workflow_dispatch: # Manual trigger
```

### 3. **Job**
A group of steps that run on the same machine (runner). Jobs can run in parallel or sequentially.

### 4. **Step**
Individual tasks within a job - either a shell command or a pre-built action.

### 5. **Runner**
The virtual machine that executes your jobs:
- `ubuntu-latest` (most common)
- `windows-latest`
- `macos-latest`
- Self-hosted runners

---

## The Mental Framework

Before writing any pipeline, answer these **three fundamental questions**:

### 1. **When should it run?** (Triggers)
- Every push to main branch?
- Only on pull requests?
- On release tags?
- On a schedule?

### 2. **Where should it run?** (Environment)
- Standard Ubuntu runner?
- Need Windows for .NET?
- macOS for iOS builds?
- Special requirements (GPU, databases)?

### 3. **What should it do?** (Actions)
- **CI**: Test ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Store artifacts
- **CD**: Deploy ‚Üí Notify ‚Üí Monitor

This framework works for **any project** - React apps, APIs, mobile apps, or microservices.

## Your First Pipeline

Let's build a simple CI pipeline step by step:

### Basic CI Pipeline
```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

# 1. WHEN: Trigger on pushes and PRs to main
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  test:
    # 2. WHERE: Run on Ubuntu
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # 3. WHAT: Checkout ‚Üí Setup ‚Üí Test
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 18
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

      - name: Build application
        run: npm run build
```

### Adding Build Artifacts
```yaml
      - name: Upload build artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: build-files
          path: dist/
```

### Environment Variables & Secrets
```yaml
      - name: Deploy to production
        env:
          API_URL: ${{ secrets.API_URL }}
          DEPLOY_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_TOKEN }}
        run: npm run deploy
```

**üí° Pro Tip**: Store sensitive data in **Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions**

---

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: React App with GitHub Pages Deployment
```yaml
name: Deploy React App

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 18
          cache: 'npm'

      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./build
```

### Example 2: Docker Build and Push
```yaml
name: Docker Build & Push

on:
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  docker:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Login to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v3
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}

      - name: Build and push
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
        with:
          context: .
          push: true
          tags: myapp:${{ github.ref_name }}
```

### Example 3: Multi-Environment Testing
```yaml
name: Cross-Platform Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
        node: [16, 18, 20]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test
```

## Best Practices

### üöÄ Performance
- **Use caching**: `cache: 'npm'` in setup actions
- **Run jobs in parallel**: Separate independent jobs
- **Fail fast**: Use `fail-fast: true` in matrix strategies

### üîí Security
- **Never hardcode secrets**: Use `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}`
- **Limit permissions**: Use `permissions:` to restrict access
- **Pin action versions**: Use `@v4` instead of `@main`

### üìù Maintainability
- **Descriptive names**: `name: "Run unit tests"` not `name: "Test"`
- **Comments**: Explain complex steps
- **Reusable workflows**: Create templates for common patterns

### üéØ Reliability
- **Separate CI and CD**: Test everything, deploy only releases
- **Use conditions**: `if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'`
- **Timeout jobs**: Add `timeout-minutes: 30`

---

## Advanced Features

### Conditional Execution
```yaml
- name: Deploy to production
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && github.event_name == 'push'
  run: npm run deploy:prod
```

### Job Dependencies
```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # ... test steps

  deploy:
    needs: test  # Only run if test succeeds
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # ... deploy steps
```

### Custom Actions
```yaml
- name: My Custom Action
  uses: ./.github/actions/my-action
  with:
    input-parameter: "value"
```

### Scheduled Workflows
```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *'  # Run daily at 2 AM
```

---

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

**‚ùå "Node.js version not found"**
```yaml
- uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: '18'  # Use quotes for version numbers
```

**‚ùå "Permission denied"**
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write
```

**‚ùå "Workflow not triggering"**
- Check file location: `.github/workflows/`
- Validate YAML syntax
- Check branch protection rules

**‚ùå "Secret not found"**
- Verify secret name spelling
- Check if secret is set at repo/org level
- Ensure proper permissions

### Debugging Tips
1. **Enable debug logging**: Add `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG: true` to repository variables
2. **Use echo statements**: `run: echo "Debug: ${{ github.event_name }}"`
3. **Check the Actions tab**: View detailed logs and timing
4. **Validate YAML**: Use online YAML validators

## Conclusion

GitHub Actions transforms how we build, test, and deploy software. Start with the mental framework (When? Where? What?), build simple pipelines first, and gradually add complexity as your needs grow.

Remember: **The best CI/CD pipeline is the one that runs reliably and saves your team time.** Focus on automating your most painful manual processes first.
